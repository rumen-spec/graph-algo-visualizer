[![GitHub Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Pages-blue?logo=github)](https://rumen-spec.github.io/graph-algo-visualizer/)

## Overview

The Graph Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive application that helps users understand and visualize the workings of various graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms. With support for Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS), this tool provides a hands-on way to explore graph theory concepts.

## Features

Algorithm Support: Visualizes the execution of Dijkstra, A*, DFS, and BFS algorithms.

Speed Control: Allows users to run simulations at Slow, Medium, and Fast speeds.

Interactive Graph: Users can customize the graph by adding or removing nodes and edges.

Pathfinding Visualization: Clearly displays the shortest path or traversal order after the algorithm completes.

Real-Time Updates: Animates the algorithm's progress in real-time for better understanding.
